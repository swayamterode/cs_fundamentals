Operating System is a **software** which takes control of your machine after it is turned on, some basic test happens and the control is given to the OS.

The **purpose** of an **operating system** is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.

Various relevant definitions of Operating Systems:

- An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.
- A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.

- An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, a memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.

- Applications **do not** have to interact with Hardware it communicates with the OS.
- OS becomes a interface for both **Application** and **Hardware(machine)**

**Operating System** provides us with basic services that are called `System Calls`

- System call for the writing data, reading data
- System call for displaying something on the screen
- Library works on the top of the system.

Services of OS

- Resource Management
- Abstraction
- Protection: Since multiple apps are running in the system so one application must not impact the other running application.

**Do we always need a manager?**

No, you don't need a manager where things are not complex!

example: The chip used in a lift, the function of the lift is to just make the lift go towards the upper floor and come down to the desired floor or the ground floor.

**Example of OS:**

**Desktop:**

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

**Android:**

- Android
- iOS
